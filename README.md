## Volunteer Quest Release Notes 
#### Alpha Version 0.0.1, released April 11, 2018

#### 1. New Features 

*Volunteer Quest is brand new in this release. Please read through all of the features you can expect to find in the application.*
	   
* **Registration** 
   You don’t have to sign-up for an account to start Questing, but if you do, you gain access to some awesome features.

   As a volunteer, registering for a volunteer account allows you to save searches, access favorites, and get notifications when events change

   As a non-profit, registration for a non-profit account allows to publish and manage volunteering events, so you can get the word out!

* **The Map**

   The map is your home base for Questing. On the map you’ll find events scattered throughout your communities. 
   
   On mobile, pinch to zoom and drag to pan the map to search an area. For those on the web, you’ll have to use the good ol’ mouse.
   
   Click on an event to view its details, save it as a favorite, or subscribe to get updates.

* **The Menu**
   On the top left of the application,  you’ll find a menu icon. Tap or click to access menu options. The available options, covered in detail ahead, are:
   * Favorites
   * Account
   * Sign Out
   * Post an Event (non-profit account only)
   * Manage Events (non-profit account only)
   
   
* **Favorites**
   Access your favorite events through the menu. You’ll be taken to a landing where events you’re interested in are saved and displayed.


* **Account**
   Access your account through the menu. You’ll be taken to a landing where you can view your messages, edit your account information, and delete your account if necessary. 

   Selecting the messages tab will display any messages in your inbox. Messages are generated from non-profit organizations whenever they change a time, event, or other detail of an event you’re subscribed to. Gotta stay in the loop!
   
   Selecting the edit account tab will open a form where you can update the contact information associated with your account.
   
   Selecting the delete account tab allows you to permanently delete your account. Please note this action cannot be undone, and your account will be lost forever. We hate to see you go, so use this sparingly.


* **Sign Out**
   Select the sign out option to take a break from Questing. Don’t worry, you can come back any time!

* **Post an Event**
   For non-profit users, this is where you can introduce the world to your organization. Select this option to post an event. A dialog will walk you through providing all the necessary details for the event.

   Use the “repeat” option to create events that repeat weekly, biweekly, or monthly within a specified date range.

* **Manage Events**
   For non-profit users, this is where you can edit and delete your events. Selecting this option provides you a list of events you’re hosting, with options to update and delete events.

* **Searching for Events**
   When you first open Volunteer Quest, the map is full of volunteering events of every category, location, and time, which can be overwhelming. Use the filter tools provided to find events you’re interested in.

   Selecting the filter icon on the right hand side of the app will bring up the filter menu. 
   
   Choose any number of categories that interest you, select a date range, and specify a location to search, and let us do the magic. Only events matching your criteria are displayed on the map after filtering.
   
   You can save your filters for later by selecting the save option on the filter dialog.

* **Take It On The Go**
   Volunteer Quest is designed to be a mobile friendly web application. This means it works as well from your computer’s browser as it does on your phone. Take the spirit of volunteering with you, wherever you go!

#### 2. Bug Fixes
*Volunteer Quest is a brand new application that is still under development. We are routinely adding new features and improving old ones. Because this is our first release, we don’t have any fixes from previous releases. In the future, bug fixes will be found in this section.*

#### 3.Known Bugs
*As mentioned, the developers at Volunteer Quest are working around the clock to bring new features to eager volunteers to better support organizations and their volunteers. New features aren’t always perfect the first time around, so here’s a list of known issues*

* **Already Taken!**
   If a user wants to register an email address that already has an account associated with it, the registration process will be denied, but the user is not notified of this rejection. 

* **Rinse, and Repeat**
    When editing an existing event, selecting the repeat option does not produce a series of repeating events.
   When editing an event that is part of a series of repeating events, editing one event in the series does not affect the others.
